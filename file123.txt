With Lynx, how do I download a page, image, or program from the web to my
account from the Unix command line prompt?

   To download from the web using Lynx from the [12]Unix command line
   prompt, enter:
 lynx -source URL > filename

   Replace URL with the URL of the page or image that you want to
   download. Replace filename with a filename that you want to give to
   what you are downloading. For example, if you are trying to download a
   web page at the address http://empire.gov/dvader.html, and you'd like
   to name the page on your account myhero.html, then you'd enter:
 lynx -source http://empire.gov/dvader.html > myhero.html

   If you want to download a web page in formatted output (i.e., without
   HTML tags, but instead as it would appear in Lynx), then enter:
 lynx -dump URL > filename

   If there are any links on the page, the URLs for those links will be
   included at the end of the downloaded page.

   At Indiana University, for personal or departmental Linux or Unix
   systems support, see [13]At IU, how do I get support for Linux or Unix?
